This is a research project for a digital humanities course taught at the University of California, Los Angeles, during the Spring quarter of 2024 under the direction of Dr. Ashley Sanders Garcia.
Our team was tasked with using methodologies to analyze a publicly accessible database of their choosing critically. This project challenged us to formulate a critical argument about this public dataset and narratively present it with a key argument.
This project uncovers the trends and underlying origins of the 300 million baby names that can be scraped from the United States Social Security Administration database of baby names from 1880 to 2022.
